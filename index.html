I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup." </blockquote>

I needed some structure of professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. He encouraged me to enroll a former student of his who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands on and I never had to wait long for help. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way no tutorial ever could. In fact, I have often referred to him during interviews as an example of my development experience, for me he is an example to follow both personally and professionally. It certainly helped me get a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommendable!" </blockquote>
